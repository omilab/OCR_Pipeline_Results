We present here a corpus of 19th century Hebrew newspapers which was created at OMILab, The Open Media and Information Lab at the Open University, Israel. OmiLabâ€™s project on Historical Newspaper Archive Research ran in collaboration with the National Library of Israel, that provided access to selected image and OCR output files at the back end of JPRESS - the Historical Jewish Press collection of the Tel Aviv University and the National Library of Israel. 

Worldwide, large historical newspapers digitization project provide oceans of valuable historical periodical data. Much of this data, however, is available in platforms that provide mediocre OCR, which hinders the application of text analytical methods of distant reading, NLP, NER and various methods of semantic processing.

In order not to lose the valuable work that was done to analyze the layout and content structure of the newspapers we created an open workflow which migrates legacy segmentation data into the open Page format, on which the improved text recognition technologies can run, and then outputs the data as a TEI-XML encoded and enriched corpus.

The format of the files:
